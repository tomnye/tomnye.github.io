## Tom Nye

I am a Senior Lecturer in statistics in the [School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths/) at [Newcastle University](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/). 

These pages describe my research interests, my research group and software projects. 
For details about my teaching, Newcastle students should visit [canvas](https://canvas.ncl.ac.uk/). 

### Research interests

* Bayesian inference of phylogenetic trees
* Non-Euclidean geometric statistics for data sets of trees and graphs
* Tree-valued stochastic processes
* Statistical modelling and manifold-valued data in computational neuroscience

### Projects

**Bayesian inference of phylogenies:** I have supervised a number of PhD students on projects involving inference of trees from genetic sequence data. 
Projects have included modelling [compositional heterogeneity](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=IFu7XnQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=IFu7XnQAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC) across branches, investigating [non-reversible Markov substitution models](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=IFu7XnQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=IFu7XnQAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC) and developing [branch-heterogeneous Lie Markov models](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=IFu7XnQAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=IFu7XnQAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC). 
I currently collaborate on a Leverhulme grant with [Martin Smith](https://smithlabdurham.github.io/) at Durham University inferring phylogenies for fossils using morphological data. 

**Principal component analysis in BHV tree space:** Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann (BHV) tree space is a beautiful space which encapsulates all possible evolutionary histories for a given set of species. 
Since BHV tree space is not a Euclidean vector space, PCA must be adapted in order to work in the new setting. 
I have developed methods for fitting [principal geodesics](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=IFu7XnQAAAAJ&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=IFu7XnQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC) and minimal [principal surfaces](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=IFu7XnQAAAAJ&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=IFu7XnQAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C).

**Stochastic processes in BHV tree space:** I have established the fundamental theory of [Brownian motion](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=IFu7XnQAAAAJ&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=IFu7XnQAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C) in BHV tree space, and I am developing inference methods for fitting these to data with a current PhD student. 

**Information geometry for phylogenetic trees:** In collaboration with researchers at Gottingen University, Germany, I have recently developed a new space of phylogenetic trees in which the metric measures the distance between trees in terms of similarity of the distributions on genetic sequences induced by the trees. 
Called [wald space](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=IFu7XnQAAAAJ&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=IFu7XnQAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC), there are still many unanswered mathematical questions, and there's great potential for developing statistical methods in this space. 

**Non-Euclidean statistics in computational neuroscience:** I collaborate with the [computational neuroscience lab](https://sites.google.com/view/cnnp-lab/) at Newcastle and co-supervise a number of students in this area.

### Background

<script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>

My [PhD](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0311215) was in pure mathematics (specifically gauge theory and global analysis); a significant output was the proof of the "[Nye-Singer index theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0009144)" for Dirac operators on $S^1\times \mathbb{R}^3$. 
After that I worked in industry as a mathematical consultant for a couple of years. 
I returned to academia with a postdoc position at the [MRC Biostatistics Unit](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk) working on problems in statistical bioinformatics. 
I started my lectureship at Newcastle in January 2006. 

As a statistician I tend to be Bayesian. Geometrical ideas often influence the way I think and solve problems.
