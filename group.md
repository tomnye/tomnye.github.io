### Nye Group, 2022/23

#### PhD students

* **Will Woodman**: Will is working on inference for Brownian motion on BHV tree space.
* **Alex Butryn**: Supported by a Leverhulme grant joint with [Martin Smith](https://smithlabdurham.github.io/) at Durham University, Alex works on inferring phylogenies from morphological data. 
* **Tao Ding**: Tao's project involves developing methods to analyse time series on Riemannian manifolds with applications to neuroscience. This project is a collaboration with [Yujiang Wang](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/profile/yujiangwang.html) from the [computational neuroscience lab](https://sites.google.com/view/cnnp-lab/) at Newcastle. 

I also act as second supervisor for two students in neuroscience:
* **[Tom Owen](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/bigdata/people/people/owentom.html)**
* **[Heather Woodhouse](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/bigdata/people/people/woodhouseheather.html)**

#### Project students

I'm taking a break from supervising masters students this year. 

#### Prospective PhD students

I encourage prospective PhD students to email me about possible projects. 
If you do this, it's a good idea to look at my research interests and papers so you have a good idea about the areas you might work on. 
For example, I do not supervise projects on Euclidean time series or econometrics, despite receiving many emails along these lines.
